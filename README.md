# Incredible Coding Quiz!

## I created and quiz about coding to test my java script skills, but to also test other people on their general coding knowledge. Creating this quiz helped better my knowledge with java script and how it's constructed. It also helped me understand the arithmitic of java script when I coded the timer for said quiz. This quiz is designed to help people who are struggling with general coding information and those who need help with javascript.
